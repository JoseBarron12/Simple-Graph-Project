# Simple Graph Program

**Data Structure:**  Graph <BR>
**Programming Focus:** General programming in c++

## Overview

Welcome to the Graph Program! This C++ program is designed to demonstrate a simple graph by reading an input file and performing a depth-first traversal. The program provides information about the graph's structure and performs a traversal, displaying the order of visited vertices and edges taken.

## Features

- **Graph Representation:**
  - Utilizes adjacency lists to represent the graph's structure.
  - Reads graph information from an input file.

- **Depth-First Traversal:**
  - Implements depth-first traversal to visit vertices in a specific order.
  - Displays the order in which vertices are visited during traversal.

## Code Organization

All the code for this project is organized into two main files:

- `graph.h`: Header file containing the class definition for the Graph.
- `graph.cc`: Implementation file containing the member function definitions for the Graph class.

The main program (`simplegraph.cc`) interacts with the Graph class, reading an input file, printing graph details, and performing a depth-first traversal.

## Output

The output file (`simplegraph.refout`) provides the expected output for the given input file. The output includes details about the graph's structure and the result of the depth-first traversal.

## Skills Showcase

This project demonstrates proficiency in several key areas:

- **C++ Programming:**
  - Utilizes C++ language features, including classes and vectors, to implement a graph data structure.
  - Demonstrates understanding of file input/output and standard template library (STL) containers.

- **Algorithm Design:**
  - Implements depth-first traversal algorithm to visit vertices in a specific order.
  - Handles backtracking when necessary during traversal.

- **File Handling:**
  - Reads graph information from an input file, allowing flexibility in graph representation.

- **Documentation:**
  - The code files (`graph.h` and `graph.cc`) include comments for clarity and understanding.

These skills collectively showcase the ability to design, implement, and document a C++ program that effectively represents and traverses a simple graph.
